# Bank of CodePath Lab

## Overview

For this activity, you'll be building out the UI for a new financial application that Codepath has been prototyping. It's a simple banking app that helps users keep track of their finances and payments using an Express API and a React UI.

Your job is to wire up the React UI to interact with the already built Express API. Data in the Express API is persisted using a JSON file that will store all user activity.

## Project Details

### Goals

By the end of this lab you will be able to...

- [ ] Make HTTP requests from React applications using `axios`
- [ ] Handle asynchronous functions using `async/await`
- [ ] Leverage the `useEffect` hook to make API requests when components mount
- [ ] Store data pulled from a remote API locally with the `useState` hook
- [ ] Create `onClick` handlers for buttons
- [ ] Manage the internal state of a form input with use state and an `onChange` handler.
- [ ] Create `onSubmit` handlers for forms
- [ ] Use React Router to navigate between pages
- [ ] Create dynamic routes with React Router
- [ ] Craft HTTP requests that use route parameter from the `useParams` hook

### Application Features

#### Core Features

- [ ] Users can add new transaction to bank: Takes in description, category, and amount. Be sure to specify what unit of currency the amount is in (i.e USD, cents, etc.)
- [ ] New transactions will be updated in the activity section with most recent at the bottom.
- [ ] Allows users to search in activities based on key words or phrases.

#### Stretch Features

- [ ] Display the current total balance of the user's bank account on the Home Page.
- [ ] Implement an `AddTransfer` component that allows users to add a transfer to their bank account.
- [ ] Create a `TransferDetail` component that displays info about an individual transfer.
- [ ] Ensure that the `FilterInput` filters both transactions and transfers.
- [ ] Add an API endpoint that allows users to indicate that they've paid off certain transactions if that transaction took money out of the account. Create a button on the `TransactionDetail` component that lets users record this information.

### Step 0: Project Setup</span>

#### Lab

Start by installing the core dependencies for this project.

- [ ] Navigate into the `bank-of-codepath-express-api` directory and run `npm install` to get the appropriate dependencies. Make sure the express server is running with `npm run dev` or `npm start` in the `api` directory.
- [ ] In a new terminal window, navigate into the `bank-of-codepath-ui` directory and run `npm install` to download the frontend dependencies. - [ ] Run `npm run dev` to get the React app started up.
- [ ] Open up `http://localhost:3000` in the browser to see the current state of the app. The API should be running at `http://localhost:3001`. That value is also stored in the `API_BASE_URL` variable inside the `constants.js` file in the frontend repo.

### Step 1: The `App.jsx` component

- [ ] Route Components
  - [ ] Import the `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route` components from `react-router-dom`
  - [ ] Inside the `return` statement in the `App.jsx` component, nest the `BrowserRouter` component inside the `div` element with a `className` of `app`.
  - [ ] Nest the `Navbar` component inside the `BrowserRouter` component.
  - [ ] Place the `Home` component inside a `main` tag that is rendered directly after the `Navbar` component.
- [ ] Define routes
  - [ ] Make the first child of the `main` tag the `Routes` component from `react-router-dom`.
  - [ ] Use the `Route` component to add an index route for the `Home` component at the `/` route
  - [ ] Import the `TransactionDetail` component into the `App.jsx` component.
  - [ ] Add a dynamic route with the base path of `transactions` that is used for displaying a single transaction with the `transactionId` path parameter. Display that page with the `TransactionDetail` component.
- [ ] State variables
  - [ ] Create default state and handlers with React's `useState` hook for the following items.
    - [ ] `isLoading` - a boolean representing whether or not the app is currently requesting data from the API
    - [ ] `transactions` - the list of bank transaction items fetched from the API
    - [ ] `transfers` - the list of bank transfer items fetched from the API
    - [ ] `error` - any errors associated with fetching data from the API
    - [ ] `filterInputValue` - a string value used to create a controlled input in the `FilterInput.jsx` component

### Step 2: The `Navbar.jsx` and `FilterInput.jsx` components

#### Inside the `Navbar.jsx` component:

- [ ] Render a nav link
  - [ ] Render the `Logo` component as the first element nested inside the `nav` element
  - [ ] Inside the `Logo` component, wrap the `img` element with a `Link` component from `react-router-dom`.
  - [ ] Pass a `path` prop to the `Logo` component that corresponds to the `Home` route. Then pass that as the `to` prop in the `Link` component
  - [ ] Clicking on the `img` element in the `Navbar` should now redirect to the Home route. Manually navigate to a different path and try it out in the browser.

#### In the `App.jsx` component:

- [ ] Pass props
  - [ ] Go ahead and pass the `filterInputValue` to the `Navbar` as the `filterInputValue` prop
  - [ ] Name the state updater function for that variable: `setFilterInputValue`. Pass that function to the `Navbar` as its `setFilterInputValue` prop.

#### Inside the `Navbar.jsx` component:

- [ ] Create a controlled input
  - [ ] Pass the `filterInputValue` to the `FilterInput.jsx` component as its `inputValue` prop.
  - [ ] Define a function called `handleOnInputChange` that takes in a `change` event and calls the `setFilterInputValue` function with the new input value extracted from the event.
  - [ ] Pass the `handleOnInputChange` function to the `FilterInput.jsx` component as its `handleOnChange` prop.

#### Inside the `FilterInput.jsx` component:

- [ ] Create a controlled input
  - [ ] Pass the appropriate props to the `input` element to create a controlled input.
  - [ ] Typing into the input should now update state. Use the React devtools to confirm this

### Step 3: The `Home.jsx` component

#### In the `App.jsx` component

- [ ] Pass props
  - [ ] Pass the state variables and updater functions as props to the `Home.jsx` component as needed:
    - `transactions`
    - `setTransactions`
    - `transfers`
    - `setTransfers`
    - `error`
    - `setError`
    - `isLoading`
    - `setIsLoading`
    - `filterInputValue`

#### In the `Home.jsx` component

- [ ] Fetch data
  - [ ] Create a `useEffect` hook that runs whenever the `Home.jsx` component is mounted to the screen
    - [ ] When the effect kicks off, it should set `isLoading` to true
    - [ ] That function should fetch all transactions and transfers from the API. You can either create two separate `useEffect` hooks to accomplish this, or do them both in the same hook. Either way, make sure to send two HTTP requests to the `/transactions` and `/transfers` endpoints with the `axios.get` method.
    - [ ] If an error occurs while fetching data, it should be added to state.
    - [ ] When data is returned from fetching data, it should be set in state accordingly.
    - [ ] When the function has finished executing, it should set `isLoading` to false
    - [ ] Make sure to call the function at the end of the `useEffect` hook.
- [ ] Custom rendering
  - [ ] Loading
    - [ ] While the app is fetching data, the `Home.jsx` component should have an `isLoading` prop equal to `true`.
      - [ ] When that prop is `true`, it should render an `h1` element with the text: `"Loading..."
      - [ ] Otherwise, render the `BankActivity` component. It should always render the `AddTransaction` component.
  - Error
    - [ ] If the `Home.jsx` component receives any defined value for its `error` prop, it should render an error message inside of an `h2` element with the className of `error`.
- [ ] Filtering transactions
  - [ ] The `Home.jsx` component should create a `filteredTransactions` array using its `transactions` prop.
  - [ ] If its `filterInputValue` prop is NOT an empty string:
    - [ ] It should filter the transactions based on whether or not the lowercased `description` property of a transaction contains the lowercased `filterInputValue`
    - [ ] Otherwise, it should just be the raw array passed as the `transactions` prop.
  - [ ] The `filteredTransactions` array should be passed to the `BankActivity` component as its `transactions` prop.

### Step 4: The `AddTransaction.jsx` component

This component is responsible for adding a new transaction to the Bank. We'll be turning each input into a _controlled input_ and adding an `onClick` handler to the submit button to make that happen.

#### In the `App.jsx` component

- [ ] Define state variables and pass props
  - [ ] Create a new state variable and updater function - `newTransactionForm` and `setNewTransactionForm`
    - [ ] The `newTransactionForm` state variable should be an object with 3 form fields - `category`, `description`, and `amount`
  - [ ] Also create one for the `isCreating` state with the `setIsCreating` state updater function
  - [ ] Pass all of them to the `Home.jsx` component as props

#### In the `Home.jsx` component

- [ ] Pass props
  - [ ] Pass the `isCreating` and `setIsCreating` props directly to the `AddTransaction` component as props
  - [ ] Pass the `newTransactionForm` to the `AddTransaction` component as its `form` prop
  - [ ] Pass the `setNewTransactionForm` to the `AddTransaction` component as its `setForm` prop
  - [ ] Define a `handleOnSubmitNewTransaction` function and pass it to the `AddTransaction` component as the `handleOnSubmit` prop

#### In the `AddTransaction.jsx` component

- [ ] Form management
  - [ ] Create a `handleOnFormFieldChange` function
    - [ ] It should take a `change` event as its single argument.
    - [ ] That function should then update individual fields in the form using the `change` event.
    - [ ] Pass that function to the `AddTransactionForm` component as its `handleOnFormFieldChange` prop.
    - [ ] Go ahead and pass the other required props to the `AddTransactionForm` component.

#### In the `AddTransactionForm` component

- [ ] Create controlled inputs
  - [ ] Make sure each input is given a `name` prop corresponding to the correct field in the `newTransactionForm`.
  - [ ] Give each input the correct `placeholder` and `type` props.
  - [ ] Give each input the correct `value` and `onChange` props as well.
  - [ ] Test that each one works by entering text into the input and using the React devtools to ensure that the correct field in the `newTransaction` form state variable is being updated
- [ ] Handle submit events
  - [ ] The `button` element with a `className` of `add-transaction` should get passed the `handleOnSubmit` function as its `onClick` prop

#### Back in the `Home.jsx` component

- [ ] Handle submit events
  - [ ] The `handleOnCreateTransaction` function
    - [ ] Should be an `async` function that starts by setting `isCreating` to `true`
    - [ ] Then, it should use the `axios.post` method to issue a `POST` request to the `/transactions` endpoint with the contents of the `newTransactionForm` as its body
      - [ ] If anything goes wrong, it should call the `setError` function with the error and set `isCreating` to `false`
      - [ ] Otherwise, it should take the new transaction returned from the API and add it to the `transactions` array in state
      - [ ] Finally, it should reset the `newTransactionForm` to its original state and set `isCreating` back to `false`
- [ ] The `AddTransaction` component should now let users submit new transactions to the backend that are stored in the database. Try running the app against the live API to see it in action.

### Step 5: The `BankActivity` component

#### Iteration in JSX

- [ ] The `BankActivity.jsx` component should iterate over its `transactions` prop and render a `TransactionRow` for each one. That component should render JSX wrapped by an element with the `className` of `transaction-row`.
- [ ] It should also iterate over its `transfers` prop and render a `TransferRow` for each one. That component should render JSX wrapped by an element with the `className` of `transfer-row`.

#### Dynamic `Link` component with `react-router-dom`

- [ ] Import the `Link` component from `react-router-dom`
- [ ] The `TransactionRow` component in the `BankActivity.jsx` file should render JSX wrapped by a `Link` component from `react-router-dom` that links to the correct transaction detail page
- [ ] Make sure to dynamically create the `to` prop based on the `id` of each transaction
- [ ] Clicking on the `TransactionRow` component should redirect to the `TransactionDetail` page for that transaction

### Step 6: The `TransactionDetail` component

- [ ] Define state variables
  - [ ] Inside the `TransactionDetail.jsx` component, create some state variables and state updater functions:
    - [ ] `hasFetched` and `setHasFetched` - default to `false`
    - [ ] `transaction` and `setTransaction` - default to `{}`
    - [ ] `isLoading` and `setIsLoading`
    - [ ] `error` and `setError`
- [ ] Extract url params
  - [ ] Import the `useParams` hook from `react-router-dom`
  - [ ] Use it to extract the `transactionId` from the url route and store it in the `transactionId` variable
- [ ] Fetch resources based on url params
  - [ ] Create a `useEffect` hook inside the component. Inside it:
    - [ ] Define an async function called `fetchTransactionById`.
      - [ ] That function should start by setting `isLoading` to `true` and `hasFetched` to `false`.
      - [ ] Then it should use `axios.get` method to issue a `GET` request to the API to fetch a single transaction by its id.
      - [ ] If there is an error, set that error in state.
      - [ ] If valid data is returned, update the `transaction` state value.
      - [ ] Set `isLoading` to `false` and `hasFetched` at the end of the function no matter what.
      - [ ] Make sure to call that function at the end of the `useEffect` hook.
    - [ ] Add the `transactionId` to the `useEffect` hook's dependency array so that it runs each time the url route changes
- [ ] Render proper component values
  - [ ] The `TransactionDetail` component should then pass the correct props to the `TransactionCard` component
  - [ ] The `TransactionCard` component should render the proper values when the `transaction` is valid
  - [ ] If no valid `transaction` is returned for that `url`, `isLoading` is `false`, and `hasFetched` is `true`, then the `TransactionCard` component should render only render the `transactionId` inside an `h3` element in the `card-header`, along with an `h1` tag that says `Not Found`.

Congrats! Try it out against the live API to make sure everything is working as expected!
